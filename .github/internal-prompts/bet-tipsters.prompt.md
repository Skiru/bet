# S2 — TIPSTER DEEP-DIVE

## Required Skills

Load these skills before starting:
- `bet-navigating-sources` — tipster sources per sport, blocked sources, fallback chains, Playwright tips

## Agent-Mandatory Warning

The `tipster_aggregator.py` produces RAW aggregated picks. **Your job is to READ actual arguments, assess quality, and discover angles stats missed:**
- **Argument quality**: Does the tipster cite real stats or just guess? (DATA-BACKED / CONTEXTUAL / OPINION)
- **Independence verification**: Are tipsters copying each other?
- **Contrarian signals**: When tipsters disagree with stats — investigate WHO has better data
- **Angle discovery**: Injuries, tactical shifts, local context that stats miss
- **Watchlist promotions** (§4.3): Statistical-market tips with cited reasoning → promote

## Context (provided by orchestrator)

- **Inputs**: `{date}_s2_shortlist.md`, `{date}_tipster_consensus.json`
- **Pre-fetched HTML**: `betting/data/zawodtyper.pl/`, `typersi.pl/`, `sportsgambler.com/`, `pickswise.com/`, `betideas.com/`
- **Script**: `python3 scripts/tipster_aggregator.py --date {date} --workers 5`
- **DB tables**: `analysis_results` (previous tipster data for same teams) — via `db_data_loader.py`

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-Check Aggregator Output

Read `{date}_tipster_consensus.json` and `.md`. Focus manual deep-dive on:
- High-consensus (>70%) → read FULL arguments
- Contradictions (tipsters vs stats) → investigate deeply
- Statistical market picks → §4.3 watchlist promotion
- Gaps (no coverage) → try emergency sources

### 2. Per-Candidate Extraction (≥2 sites per candidate)

For each site: navigate → find event → read FULL arguments → record tipster name, pick, odds, argument summary, cited facts. Calculate consensus %.

### 3. §4.3 Watchlist Promotion (MANDATORY)

Scan ALL tipster HTML for statistical-market picks NOT in shortlist. If: stat market + argument-backed + in window → add to LISTA OBSERWACYJNA.

### 4. Tipster Intelligence Thinking Layer (MANDATORY per candidate)

- **Argument quality**: DATA-BACKED / CONTEXTUAL / OPINION
- **Independence**: HIGH / LOW / MIXED with evidence
- **Contrarian signal**: refuted or incorporated
- **New angle**: impact assessment
- **Intelligence confidence modifier**: +0.5 / 0 / −0.5 / −1.0

## Output

Save to: `betting/data/{date}_s2_tipsters.md`

Must start with **TIPSTER COVERAGE SUMMARY TABLE** (event, sites checked, consensus %, status). Then per-candidate sections with source tables and consensus analysis. End with §4.3 Watchlist Promotion section.

## Self-Verification

Key gates: ≥2 tipster sites per candidate, argument quality rated, independence checked, §4.3 promotion complete.

## Pass/Fail Gate

ALL checks pass → "S4 PASSED" → orchestrator proceeds to S5.
