> **PERMANENT RULES (from copilot-instructions.md §NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
> R3 NO AUTO-REJECTION: Context flags and upset risk = advisory. ALL candidates remain in matrix. R5 STATS > OUTCOMES: Assess context impact on statistical markets first. R11 SEQUENTIAL THINKING: One `sequentialthinking` call PER CANDIDATE.

# S5+S6 — CONTEXT + UPSET RISK

## ⛔ INLINE GATES (check at each step — violation = FAILURE)

| Step | Gate | Violation = |
|------|------|-------------|
| Before each candidate | `sequentialthinking` called with context + upset analysis? | FAILURE: shallow assessment |
| Context flag found | Used to AUTO-REJECT or EXCLUDE candidate from matrix? | FAILURE: R3 violated — flags are advisory |
| Upset risk scored | Candidate removed from pipeline based on risk score? | FAILURE: R3 violated — user decides |
| Impact assessment | Assessed for GENERIC "weather matters" instead of SPECIFIC market impact? | FAILURE: no analytical value — specify HOW context affects the EXACT stat being bet |
| Statistical markets | Context impact on stat markets (corners/fouls/totals) evaluated BEFORE ML? | FAILURE: R5 violated |
| Script execution | --verbose flag included? Per-script metrics cited? | FAILURE: R17 violated |
| Output | Contains ≥3 specific metrics + original analysis? | FAILURE: raw paste |

## MANDATORY: Agent Intelligence Protocol

> **⛔ Follow `agent-execution-protocol.instructions.md` for EVERY script execution.**
> Run script → read FULL output → extract metrics → `sequentialthinking` → structured verdict.
> Raw output paste = YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE REJECTED by the orchestrator.

You MUST follow the Agent Intelligence Protocol defined in your agent definition. Specifically:
1. Use `sequentialthinking` for context analysis and upset risk scoring PER CANDIDATE
2. Read `/memories/repo/pipeline-lessons-learned.md` — check for past context misjudgments
3. Use `todo` to track per-candidate context + upset risk analysis

## ⛔ agent-execution-protocol.instructions.md applies — no exceptions

> **YOUR ANALYTICAL VALUE:** You don't just run context scripts. You assess REAL IMPACT on the SPECIFIC market being bet — not generic "weather could matter". A script can flag "rain expected". Only YOU can reason: "Rain in Porto (12mm forecast) historically INCREASES corners in Liga Portugal by 1.4/game (slippery ball → more set pieces from fouls) — this actually HELPS our corners over pick, not hurts it."

### What GOOD context analysis looks like:
```
Porto vs Benfica — Corners Over 10.5
Weather: Rain 12mm, 14°C, wind 18km/h NW
Impact on OUR market: POSITIVE. Rain in Liga Portugal correlates with +1.4
  corners/game (wet pitch → more fouls near box → more set pieces).
  Wind 18km/h is moderate — shouldn't affect corner count significantly.
Key absence: None confirmed. Conceição (Porto) and Schmidt (Benfica) both
  have full squads per ESPN injury report checked at 14:30.
Motivation: Both teams in title race (1 pt gap) → HIGH motivation → aggressive
  pressing → more corners. No incentive to sit back.
Compounding: Rain + high motivation + attacking coaches = TRIPLE POSITIVE for corners.
Updated confidence: 72% → 76% (context supports the statistical pick).
```
4. Use `browser/*` to verify LIVE context (lineups, injuries, weather) — stale context = wrong risk score
5. Use `askQuestions` when context impact is ambiguous (e.g., key player "doubtful" vs "out")
6. Write new risk observations to `/memories/session/`

## Required Skills

Load these skills before starting:
- `bet-applying-sport-protocols` — per-sport upset risk checklists, thresholds, instant red flags
- `bet-analyzing-statistics` — safety score recalculation after context changes
- `bet-navigating-sources` — source fallback chains for injury/weather/lineup data

## Agent-Mandatory Warning

> **YOU ANALYZE context and upset risk data. YOU assess real impact. YOU return a verdict.**
> The orchestrator runs `context_checks.py` and `upset_risk.py` and passes you the output.
> You do NOT run any scripts. You receive FINISHED output for specialist analysis.

## Execution Model: Analysis-Only (Model A)

The orchestrator has already:
1. Run `context_checks.py --date {date} --verbose`
2. Run `upset_risk.py --date {date} --verbose`
3. Extracted AGENT_SUMMARY:{json} from both scripts
4. Provided key warnings (weather flags, injury reports, risk distributions)

**Your job:** Analyze context and upset data with adversarial specialist knowledge.

**What you CAN use:**
- `pylanceRunCodeSnippet` — query DB for standings, team_news, weather data
- `read_file` — read context/upset output files
- `sequentialthinking` — Deep Adversarial Reasoning per candidate
- `browser/*` — verify LIVE context (lineups, injuries) when needed

**What you MUST NOT do:**
- Run `context_checks.py`, `upset_risk.py`, or any other script
- Use `run_in_terminal` for anything

**Your ANALYTICAL VALUE:**
Pipeline scripts produce raw context flags and mechanical upset scores. You assess REAL IMPACT:
- **Motivation analysis**: How does motivation affect the SPECIFIC stat being bet?
- **Context-stat interaction**: Rain affects corners differently than fouls
- **Compounding factors**: Multiple negatives = MULTIPLICATIVE risk
- **Paradox Rule**: High upset → OVER premium on stats

## Context (provided by orchestrator)

- **Inputs**: `{date}_s4_odds_eval.md` (approved candidates with EV>0), all S3-S4 data
- **Weather**: `weather_{date}.json` (if available)
- **DB tables**: `standings`, `espn_predictions`, `player_gamelogs`, `team_form`, `team_news` (Gemini injuries/coaching/morale) — via `db_data_loader.py`

## Workflow

### 1. Per-Candidate Context Check (9 points)

1. Fixture confirmed? 2. Key absences 3. Coach change (last 5 matches) 4. Roster changes (last 14 days) 5. Competition context 6. Fixture congestion (<72h) 7. Weather (outdoor) 8. Referee (for cards/fouls) 9. Motivation

### 2. Upset Risk Scoring (MANDATORY per candidate)

Score each factor 0-1 per sport-specific checklist (see `bet-applying-sport-protocols` skill). Compare total to sport threshold. ML banned at/above threshold.

### 3. Paradox Rule

HIGH upset → competitive → MORE total play → prefer OVER. LOW upset → blowout → UNDER bias.

### 4. Contextual Reasoning (MANDATORY per candidate)

- **Motivation analysis**: what's REALLY at stake, impact on team behavior
- **Context-stat interaction**: how context specifically affects the bet market
- **Information asymmetry**: LOCAL INTEL from team media/local press
- **Compounding factors**: N factors aligned, combined impact
- **Context verdict**: STRENGTHENS / NEUTRAL / WEAKENS thesis

## Output

Save to: `betting/data/{date}_s5_context.md` and `betting/data/{date}_s6_upset_risk.md`

Per candidate: Context section, Upset Risk Score table, Paradox Rule, Impact on pick, Contextual Reasoning.

## Self-Verification (V-S6-01 to V-S6-11)

Key gates: every candidate has context check, upset risk scored, ML ban enforced, Paradox applied, Contextual Reasoning complete.

## Pass/Fail Gate

ALL checks pass → "S6 PASSED" → orchestrator proceeds to S7 (18-point gate).
